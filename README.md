# CapStone Project: Enhancing a Community Library Website

Background Scenario

You're part of a development team tasked with enhancing the website for the "Greenwood Community Library." The website aims to be more engaging and informative for its visitors. It currently includes basic sections: Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us. Your team decides to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the "Events" page to feature upcoming community events.

You will simulate the roles of two contributors: "Morgan" and "Jamie." Morgan will focus on adding the "Book Reviews" section, while Jamie will update the "Events" page with new community events.
